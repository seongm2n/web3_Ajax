        he Web was envisioned by Tim as a global information-sharing
        space that would connect people and encourage understanding
        and sharing of knowledge. It is now an indispensable, exciting
        and, in some cases a vital global commons. We are incredibly
        grateful to our Director, Tim Berners-Lee, for the invention of
        the Web, for founding the World Wide Web Consortium, for all his
        work to keep the Web open, international, accessible, and for
        his decades of inspiration to so many of us.
